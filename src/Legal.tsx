          with general law. We are not obliged to monitor transmitted or stored third-party

        <h2>Liability for links</h2>

          This site contains links to external websites over whose content we have no control. We

        <h2>Short version</h2>
        <p>
          This website sets no cookies, runs no analytics, and embeds no trackers or third-party
          fonts. It is a static page hosted on GitHub Pages. The only personal data processed is what
          your browser necessarily sends when requesting any web page, plus one optional request to
          GitHub's public API to show live repository information.
        </p>

        <h2>Controller</h2>

        <h2>Hosting (GitHub Pages)</h2>
        <p>
          This site is hosted on GitHub Pages, a service of GitHub, Inc. (USA). When you open the
          site, GitHub automatically processes connection data (your IP address, the requested file,
          and the date and time) in server log files. This is technically necessary to deliver the
          page and to maintain security and stability. Legal basis: Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR (legitimate
          interest in secure, reliable delivery). See{' '}
          <a href="https://docs.github.com/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
            GitHub's Privacy Statement
          </a>
          .
        </p>

        <h2>Live repository data (GitHub API)</h2>
        <p>
          To display current project information such as star counts and last-updated dates, the page
          makes a request from your browser to <code>api.github.com</code>. This transmits your IP
          address to GitHub as part of that request. If you do not want this, you can block the
          request; the rest of the page still works from a local snapshot. Legal basis: Art. 6(1)(f)
          GDPR.
        </p>

        <h2>Fonts</h2>
        <p>
          The Inter typeface is bundled with the site and served from the same origin. No request is
          made to Google Fonts or any other third-party font service, so no data is shared with them.
        </p>

        <h2>Cookies, analytics, tracking</h2>
        <p>None. The site stores nothing on your device and does not profile visitors.</p>

        <h2>External links</h2>
        <p>
          Project links point to GitHub repositories and project pages, and the footer links to
          GitHub, Discord and Ko-fi. These are operated by third parties under their own privacy
          policies; this policy does not cover them.
        </p>

        <h2>Your rights under the GDPR</h2>
        <p>You have the right to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>access the data we hold about you (Art. 15),</li>
          <li>rectification (Art. 16) and erasure (Art. 17),</li>
          <li>restriction of processing (Art. 18),</li>
          <li>data portability (Art. 20),</li>
          <li>object to processing (Art. 21).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a data protection supervisory authority
          (Art. 77 GDPR). To exercise any of these, contact us at the email above.
